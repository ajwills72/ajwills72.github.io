		<h2>Description</h2>	
		ALCOVE simulation of the Nosofsky et al. (1994, Memory and Cognition) replication of
		Shepard, Hovland and Jenkins (1961). Note that this simulation differs from that
		reported in Nosofsky et al. (1994) - that simulation was a non-standard version of
		ALCOVE, not used before or since. Specifically, it uses a background-noise ratio rule
		rather than an exponential ratio rule. 

		This DAU contains the R and other files needed to run this simulation.
