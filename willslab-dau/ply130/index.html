    <h2>Description</h2> Test-potentiated learning experiment
    examining associative recognition performance, reported in <a href
    = "">Seabrooke, Hollins, Wills, Mitchell (submitted)</a>,
    Experiment 3.  This DAU contains raw data and analysis scripts, in
    open cross-platform formats (see the
      <a href = "../formats.html">file format notes</a>). The raw data
      file also contains the full set of stimulus items, as the
      stimuli presented on each trial are recorded (see below).
      
     <h2>Resources</h2>
      
      <ul>
        <li><a href = "TPL3_LongData.csv">TPL3_LongData.csv</a>
          (1.1 MB) - Trial-level raw data.Column headings are as
          follows:</li>
	<ul>
	  <li>Subject - Participant number, unique to ply130</li>
	  <li>Experiment - Experiment name</li>
	  <li>Sex - Gender of participant (female, male)</li>
	  <li>Age - Age of participant (in years)</li>
	  <li>Pool - method of recruiting participants (Plymouth
	  University paid pool)</li>
	  <li>Group - Counterbalancing condition for order of encoding
	    phases (Meaning-Study or Study-Meaning)</li>
	  <li>Test - Recognition group (Associative or Item [target]
	    recognition</li>
	  <li>Running - Combines phase and w/subj condition of
	    experiment. [Study, Meaning] indicate an encoding trial in
	    the corresponding condition. [AssociativeRecognition,
	    ItemRecognition] indicates a recognition trial.</li>
	  <li>Sample - Within-phase trial number (resets at the
	    beginning of each new encoding phase, and at the start of the
	    recognition tests).</li>
	  <li>Cue - The presented cue word. Set to NA in the
	    ItemRecognition (target recognition) test.</li>
	  <li>Target - The presented target word.</li>
	  <li>Acc - Whether the participant's response is correct (1) or incorrect
	    (0). In the Study condition of the encoding phase, set to NA.</li>
	  <li>RT - The time (in ms) from onset of the cue to the participant
	    repsonse. In the Study condition of encoding phase, set to NA.</li>
	  <li>Resp - The participant's response. In the associative
	    recognition test, 'Yes' means that the participant thought that the
	    cue and target were presented together during the encoding phase. 'No'
	    means that the participant thought the cue and target were not
	    presented together during the encoding phase.</li>
	  <li>Condition - Combines congruency and encoding
	    condition. In [Meaning, Study] encoding condition, [1, 2]
	    indicate whether that cue/target word pair will later
	    serve as a paired or re-paired trial (if the participant
	    is allocated to the associative recognition group). 1 =
	    Paired, 2 = Re-paired.  [Meaning, Study] in the
	    Associative Recognition/Item Recognition test phases refer
	    to the encoding condition that the items wer allocated
	    to. [Foil] refers to items that were not presented during
	    the encoding phase for the Item (target) recognition
	    group.</li>
	  <li>Congruency - The congruency of the cue and target (for
	    the associative recognition group). 'Matched' = 'Paired', 'Unmatched'
	    = 'Re-paired'. Set to NA in the item recognition test.</li>
	</ul>

	  <li>R scripts for analysis of PL130. You will
	  need <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>. You will
	  also need to have installed the following packages that are
	  available on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>:
	  cowplot, dplyr, ez, ggplot2, pastecs, plyr, pwr, Rmsic.

	  <ul>

	    <li><a href="TPL3Functions.R">TPL3Functions.R</a> -
	    functions required by the other script, below.</li>
	
            <li><a href = "tpl3-analysis.R">tpl3-analysis.R</a> - All
            statistical analysis reported in the mansucript.</li>
