    <h1>Data and Analysis Unit: PLY034 (aka. PU012)</h1>
    
       <h2>Description</h2>

      Simulations investigating the
      decision-boundary strategy analyses conducted in the COVIS
      literature as reported in
      <a href = "">Edmunds, Milton, Wills (accepted)</a>.

      This DAU contains simulation files, functions, simulation output
      and scripts to construct the tables, all in open cross-platform
      formats (see the
      <a href = "../formats.html">file format notes</a>).

      <h2>Issues</h2>

      <i>2019-02-20</i>: (open). Simulation 1, UD strategy, at
      zero noise, sometimes returns an incorrect answer if run on more than 8
      cores (the published simulations used 4-8 cores).
