		<h2>Description</h2>	
		Triad classification task, reported in Experiment 3A of Wills, Inkster, and Milton (submitted).		
		
		This DAU contains stimulus files, raw data, and an analysis script, all in open 
		cross-platform formats (see the <a href = "../formats.html">file format notes</a>).

		<li><a href = "plym2code.txt">plym2code.txt</a> (1 KB) - The main purpose of this file is to facilitate
		automated analysis of plym2data.txt by plym2analysis.R. Column headings 
		are as follows:
		<ul>
			<li>triad: Triad ID (as used in plym2data.txt)

			<li>triplet: Triplet ID. Any given stimulus triplet can be presented in six different ways 
(three stimuli can be placed in three physical locations in six different ways). Hence,
there are six different stimulus triad IDs for each triplet ID.

			<li>top1: Stimulus ID for stimulus presented at the top of the triad. 
			Stimulus ID is a two-digit co-ordinate code in arbitrary units. For example 
			Stimulus ID 25 indicates a value of 2 on the dot-density dimension and a value of 5 
			on the length dimension.  Larger values on the dot-density dimension are associated 
			with increasing number of dots per inch. Larger values on the length 
			dimension are associated with increasing length of the line. 
			The mapping between these stimulus IDs and the numbering of the
			graphic files in this archive, are as follows:
			1 = 11, 2 = 51, 3 = 22, 4 = 42, 5 = 24, 6 = 44, 7 = 15, 8 = 55

		<li> mid2: Stimulus ID for stimulus presented in the middle of the triad. 
		<li> bot3: Stimulus ID for stimulus presented at the bottom of the triad. 
		<li> dot: Response expected if classifying on the basis of dot density
				( 1 = top , 2 = middle, 3 = bottom )
		<li> size: Response expected if classifying on the basis of length
		<li> os: Response expected if classifying on the basis of overall similarity
		<li> ident: Response expected if classifying on the basis of the identical attribute.	
		<li> nbr: Response expected if classifying on the basis of the number of dots 
		each stimulus contains.	
		</ul>
<li><a href = "barrattkey.txt">barrattkey.txt</a> (1 KB) - This file facilitates automated analysis of the
		impulsivity rating data. Column headings are as follows:
		<ul>	
		<li> qu - Question number in the Barrat Impulsivity Questionnaire, see plym1qu.txt
		<li> att - Attentional subscale (0 = This qu. is not on this subscale, 1 = normal coded qu on this subscale, 
		-1 = reverse coded qu on this subscale)
		<li> mot - Motor subscale
		<li> non - Nonplanning subscale
		</ul>	
		</ul>
