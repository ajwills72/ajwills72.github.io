I have written and/or maintain the following Creative Commons teaching resources:

- [Aspects of consciousness](/aspects-consciousness): Two sets of partially interactive sessions on the philosophy and scientific study of consciousness. 

- [Critical Thinking](/critical-thinking): A set of lectures on the basics of thinking critically, applied to the study of psychology as a science.

- [RMINR](/rminr): _Research Methods in R_ is a set of guides on how to use R as your central research methods tool. The target audience is psychology undergraduate students. 

- [RMIP](/rmip): A twelve-week course on research methods, aimed at second-year undergraduate psychology students. 

I've also written some [older materials](http://www.willslab.org.uk/teach.html) that I no longer actively maintain.
