Stephen is a researcher of animal behaviour, and of economic psychology. He's also a former Head of School (twice), and former Deputy Vice Chancellor, of Exeter University. Stephen was a key factor in me applying to work at Exeter. We've worked together for many years, mainly on comparative studies of pigeon and human category learning.
