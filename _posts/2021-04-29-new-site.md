I've maintained a personal website since 2000. It
was entirely hand-coded HTML until around 2014, 
when I added the bibtexbrowser PHP script to handle
my publication list. Oh, and in 2012, I added a 
link to a blogspot blog.

It's now 2021, and the website looks awful on both
desktops and mobiles -- quite an achievement!
This is an attempt to fix that.

(And the main point of this post is to test the 
blogging function).
