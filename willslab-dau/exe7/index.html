		<h2>Description</h2>	
		Match-to-standards classification task with digit-counting concurrent load task,
		 reported in Wills et al. (2013, QJEP, Experiment 2).
		This DAU contains stimulus files, raw data,
		and an analysis script, in open 
		cross-platform formats (see the <a href = "../formats.html">file format notes</a>)

		<li><a href = "exe7data.csv">exe7data.csv</a> (181 KB) - Trial-level raw data. Column headings are as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>cond: Experimental condition. "load" = Concurrent load, "noload" = No current load. 				
				<li>subj: Participant number (unique within EXE7)
				<li>phase: Experiment phase. "prac" = practice phase, "exp" = main phase.
				<li>block: Experiment block (starts at zero for practice block)
				<li>trial: Trial number (resets between blocks)
				<li>stim: The to-be-classified stimulus presented, numbers refer to stimulus file names in exe7stim.tbz (in the 
				practice phase, this is set to zero).
				<li>resp: Participant's classification response (A = category A, B = category B) 
				<li>rt: Participant's reaction time for classification response (in milliseconds)
			</ul>

		end of experiment.  In column 'report', 'ud' = unidimensional sort reported, 'os' = overall similarity sort reported,
		'other' = other sort reported, 'changesort' = participant reported changing sort strategy during task, 'lost' = questionnaire
		for this participant was lost. In column 'reportdim', for participants who reported a UD sort, this is the dimension(s) they
		reported using.

			E-prime 2.0. Developed from original code used in experiment, which was E-Prime 1. This E-prime 2 version has not
			been thoroughly bug-checked.

			Experiment 1B concurrent load task under
			E-prime 2.0 (from EXE5 archive). Developed from original code used in experiment, which was E-Prime 1. This E-prime 2 version has not
			been thoroughly bug-checked.  Requires audio files in exe5stimAudio.tbz to be extracted from that archive and
			placed in same directory as ES2 file. Must be run on a different computer to exe5eprimeMTS.tbz, with a parallel port
			connection between the two computers (MTS program starts and stops digit stream through this link).
