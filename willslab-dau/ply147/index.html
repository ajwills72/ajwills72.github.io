    <h2>Description</h2> Test-potentiated learning experiment
    examining 2AFC test performance with familiar versus unfamiliar
    foils, reported in <a href = "">Seabrooke, Hollins, Wills,
    Mitchell (submitted)</a>, Experiment 4.  This DAU contains raw
    data and analysis scripts, in open cross-platform formats (see the
      <a href = "../formats.html">file format notes</a>). The raw data
      file also contains the full set of stimulus items, as the
      stimuli presented on each trial are recorded (see below).

      <ul>
        <li><a href = "TPL4_LongData.csv">TPL4_LongData.csv</a>
          (1.7 MB) - Trial-level raw data.Column headings are as
          follows:</li>
	<ul>
	  <li>Subject - Participant number, unique to ply147.</li>
	  <li>Experiment - Experiment name.</li>
	  <li>Sex - Gender of participant (female, male)</li>
	  <li>Age - Age of participant (in years)</li>
	  <li>Pool - method of recruiting participants (Plymouth
	  University points pool)</li>
	  <li>Group - Counterbalancing condition for order of encoding
	    phases (Meaning-Study or Study-Meaning)</li>
	  <li>Test - Foil familiarity group (Familiar or Unfamiliar)</li>
	  <li>Running - Combines phase and w/subj condition of
	    experiment. [Study, Meaning] indicate an encoding trial in
	    the corresponding condition. [Test] refers to the
	    two-alternative forced choice test, with either familiar
	    or unfamiliar foils.</li>
	  <li>Condition - Combines test-list variable with encoding
	    condition.  [Test-Cue, Non-Test Cue] in the [Meaning,
	    Study] encoding conditions refers to whether the item was
	    allocated the to test list or not. Cues (and targets)that
	    were allocated to the test list were scheduled to be
	    presented in the final recognition test. Targets that were
	    allocated to the non-test list were scheduled to be
	    presented as foils in the final recognition test for the
	    Familiar Foils group. [Meaning, Study] in the Test phase
	    refers to the encoding condition that the cue was
	    allocated to.</li>
	  <li>Cue - The presented cue word.</li>
	  <li>Target - The presented target word.</li>
	  <li>Foil target - The presented foil word. Set to blank in
	    the [Meaning, Study] encoding phases.</li>
	  <li>Resp - The participant's response. Set to blank in the
	  Study phase.</li>
	  <li>Acc - Whether the participant's response is correct (1)
	    or incorrect (0). In the Study condition of the encoding
	    phase, set to NA.</li>
	  <li>RT - The time (in ms) from onset of the cue to the
	    participant repsonse. In the Study condition of encoding
	    phase, set to NA.</li>
	</ul>

	  <li>R scripts for analysis of PL147. You will
	  need <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>. You will
	  also need to have installed the following packages that are
	  available on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>:
	  ez, ggplot2, pastecs, plyr, pwr, Rmisc

            statistical analysis reported in the mansucript.</li>
