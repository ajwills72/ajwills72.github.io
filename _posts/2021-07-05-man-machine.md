In recent years, there have been quite a few claims that state-of-the-art AI has reached human levels of perfomrance in object recognition. In a recent talk, I briefly discuss some of the evidence against that view, including some preliminary unpublished work from my lab. You can now view that talk on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14OFq__r-Xc). 

TL;DR - you don't have to worry about the AI apocalypse just yet...
