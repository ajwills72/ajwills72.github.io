I supervised Fraser's Master's thesis, and then his Ph.D., at Exeter University. He's worked at Exeter ever since, first as a post-doc, then as a lecturer, and now a senior lecturer. I left Exeter for Plymouth in 2012, but we've continued to work together regularly. He is, by far, the person I have co-authored most papers with ... something like one in every three papers I've published have been with Fraser!
