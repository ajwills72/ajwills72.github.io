<h2>Resources</h2>
Each archive file contains four pairs of .hdr/.img files (NIfTI format). 
The last three digits of the filename identify the file. For most 
participants, the identification is as follows:
<ul>
<li>...301 - fMRI data, training phase, run 1.
<li>...401 - fMRI data, training phase, run 2.
<li>...501 - fMRI data, test phase, run 1
<li>...601 - structural MRI data.
</ul>
It is possible that, for some participants, the numbers start
higher than 301, and/or that they do not increase in steps of 100.
However, the lowest number is always training phase, run 1, the
second lowest training phase run 2, and so on.

<p> <b>NOTE:</b> Each
archive is approx. 125MB, and there are 62 participants included
in this archive. Thus,
in total these files contain almost 8GB of data, and may take
a few hours to download with a fast connection. 
If you would like to download in 
a more automated manner, the URLs are

Alternatively I can post you a memory stick of these data 
at cost of materials and postage, on request.
