Chris researches learning, memory, and attention at the School of Psychology, Plymouth University. Chris and I first met at an associative learning workshop in Belgium, and I later hosted him during a sabbatical at Exeter University. Chris joined Plymouth University in 2011 and was a major factor in my move to Plymouth in 2012.
