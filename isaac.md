Andy has self-built two "Philosopher's Desktops" (an allusion the the philosopher's broom, in the sense they are built at a certain time but tend to have bits added or replaced over the years. Somewhat arbitrarily, it's a new machine if the case is replaced.

PD1 (unnamed), built inside an aluminum case bought in 2003 and initially using a Pentium 4 processor, ended up as a Core 2 Quad machine. It had a least a couple of different graphics cards, too, and hard drive upgrades. It was repurposed as a Linux server in 2012, and was finally scrapped in 2020.

PD2 was built in December 2017, and named "isaac".
