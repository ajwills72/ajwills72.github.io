Janice works at Exeter University, where she is currently the Provost, and was previously Deputy Vice-Chancellor for Education. She's a central figure in the development of the UK's [Teaching Excellence Framework](https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/teaching/about-the-tef/). While I was at Exeter, we co-authored a paper with Cath Haslam.
