Charlotte works at Bath Spa University. I supervised her undergraduate dissertation at Exeter, and then her Ph.D. at Plymouth; both on category learning and the computational modelling thereof. She was subsequently a post-doc at Queen Mary, University of London, and Warwick Business School, before taking the lectureship at Bath Spa.
