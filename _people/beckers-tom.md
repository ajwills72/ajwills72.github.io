Tom is a Professor at KU Leuven. During a chance discussion at a workshop, we discovered we were both working on comparative studies of the Shanks-Darby procedure -- he with rats with Elisa Maes, and I with pigeons with Stephen Lea. Rather than attempting to each rush a short paper into print, we agreed to co-author a longer manuscript containing both data sets.
