<p>Hi, I'm Dr. Andy J. Wills, Ph.D. (he/him). I have researched the cognitive processes
  of humans and other animals - in particular, learning, memory, and
  classification - for almost 30 years. I've also taught Research
  Methods, and Cognitive [Psychology / Neuroscience / Science] (select your
  preferred term), to undergraduate psychology students for more than two decades.

<p>Since 2012, I have received a salary, as a Professor of Psychology, from the <a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/schools/psychology">School of Psychology</a> at the University of Plymouth. However, this is a
    personal website; it is not affilitated with or endorsed by my employer.
