I came across this 2019 book in a second hand bookstore in Salisbury in the summer of 2020, and rediscovered it on my home office bookshelf a month or so back. Written by [Caroline Criado Perez](https://carolinecriadoperez.com/) it's an accessible and scholarly list of the very many ways in which the data we have about ourselves and our world systematically under-represents women. Caroline starts this book (her second) with a quote from Simone de Beauvoir:

_"Representation of the world, like the world itself, is the work of men; they describe it from their own point of view, which they confuse with the absolute truth"_

What Caroline's book comprehensively demonstrates is that - 70 years later - this is still the case. One of the many things I liked about this book is the acceptance that thinking beyond one's own lived experience is hard for everyone - and that, thus, the natural way to address the _gender data gap_ is to ensure women are well represented in data collection, interpretation, and decision making. 

Caroline has a new book coming out next year, "Now You See Us". Looking forward to it!
