<p>Hi, I'm Dr. Andy J. Wills, Ph.D. (he/him). I have researched the cognitive processes
  of humans and other animals - in particular, learning, memory, and
  classification - for almost 30 years. I've also taught Research
  Methods to undergraduate psychology students for more than two decades.

<p>I currently receive a salary from the <a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/schools/psychology">
    School of Psychology</a> at the University of Plymouth. However, this is a
    personal website; the views expressed herein do not necessarily represent the views of my employer.
