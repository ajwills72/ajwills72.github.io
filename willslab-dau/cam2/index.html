		<i>Last update: 2014-08-28 by Andy Wills</i><p>

		<h2>Description</h2>	
		Category learning task, reported in Wills (2002, Experiment 1).		
		DAU created after publication in response to a raw data request (C. Myers, 2014).

		This DAU contains stimulus files, raw data for conditions 2500 ms and 1000 ms,
		and an analysis script, in open 
		cross-platform formats (see the <a href = "../formats.html">file format notes</a>) 
		The 130-item test phase was immediately followed by a 
		24-item single-icon test. These data were not reported in Wills (2002) due to
		space limitations, but are included in this DAU.

		<h2>Resources</h2>
		<ul>
		<li><a href = "../cam1/cam1stim.tbz">cam1stim.tbz</a> (11 KB) - Stimulus image files (from CAM1; stimuli 
		1-36 used in the current study).
		<li><a href = "cam2data.txt">cam2data.txt</a> (388 KB) - Trial-level raw data. 
		Column headings are as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>cond: Experimental condition. 1 = "2500 ms", 2 = "1000 ms"
				<li>subj: Participant number (unique within CAM2)
				<li>key: Key counter-balance condition. 1: "X" - Category A, ">" - Category B. 2: vice versa. 
				<li>phase: Experiment phase. 1 = training, 2 = test, 3 = single-icon test.  
				Where phase = 0, the prototypes of categories A and B are listed, with trial specifying 
			the category (1 = "A", 2 = "B"). The other columns are meaningless in phase 0.
			Phase 0 was not experienced by participants, it represents the computerized generation of the protoypes before
			the participant enters the room.							
				<li>trial: Trial number (resets between phases)
				<li>catordist: Phase-specific. 
				<ul>
					<li>Phase 1: The category from which the training item was generated. 1 = "A", 2 = "B"
					<li>Phase 2: Number of category A elements (0-12)
					<li>Phase 3: The category to which the icon is typically assigned in training.  1 = "A", 2 = "B".
				</ul>
				<li>ic1 (through to ic12): The icon(s) making up the presented stimulus. The numbers
				correspond to the filenames in cam1stim.tbz (e.g. "1" indicates "1.png").  In phase 3, only one icon
				is presented per trial, and this is represented in ic1 (ic2-ic12 are set to zero). In phases 1 and 2,
				12 icons are presented. The arrangement of icons ic1-ic12 on the screen in phases 1-2 is as follows:
				<br>1 ,2 ,3 ,4
				<br>5 ,6 ,7 ,8
				<br>9,10,11,12
				<br>
				<li>resp: Participant's response. 1 = "A", 2 = "B",  255 = participant timed out, 
				-1 = "no response required" (training is observational)
				<li>rt: Participant's reaction time (in seconds). -1 = "no response required".
				-255 = participant timed out.
			</ul>
			<li><a href = "cam2analysis.R">cam2analysis.R</a>  (6 KB) -  R script replicating Wills (2002), in so far as that
			is possible (Wills (2002) has three conditions, only two of which are included in this DAU.)

			<li> <a href = "../cam1/cam1vid.mp4">cam1vid.mp4</a> (1.4 MB) - Short video showing written instructions 
			and an illustrative few trials of training and test in CAM1. CAM2 is similar, but with addition of time-out procedure
			and final single-symbol test. This video was created using QuickTime Player screen 
			recording of a BBC BASIC V program running under emulation (Virtual A5000) on Windows XP, in turn running
			on Parallels 9 on a Late 2013 MacPro.  The video was subsequently edited using iMovie.
			It is a reasonably close, but not exact, representation of how the
			experiment ran on an Acorn RiscPC 600. 
			<li> <a href = "cam2source.tbz">cam2source.tbz</a> (6 KB) - BBC BASIC V source code as text files, for
			the 2.5s timeout condition. For Acorn RiscPC 600/700/StrongARM or Acorn A5000.	The graphics files are accessed by BASIC V via
a SpriteFile (not included). cam2data.txt was compiled from the "DETAIL" data files created from this program.
