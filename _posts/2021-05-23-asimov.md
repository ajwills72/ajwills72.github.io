Bought this three-volume set in [The Book Cupboard](https://www.secondhandbooksplymouth.co.uk/) shortly after first lockdown, and finally finished them (in between several other books) last night. An interesting and varied collection of early writings from the science fiction writer I have probably read the most over the years, but if you've not read Asimov before, perhaps [start here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series). Also, probably worth reading about his life, including his unacceptable [behaviour towards women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov#Behavior_towards_women).
