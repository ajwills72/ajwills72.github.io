title: Not On Spotify
subtitle: Obscure stuff I like
---

Spotify is a convenient cloud-based service. I've discovered a lot of new music on it, including obscure stuff by artists I've been following for forty years. For example, as I write his (23-01-2022) I'm listening to _Les Granges_Brulees_ by Jean-Michel Jarre for the first time. On the other side of that coin, Spotify does not contain my entire current library, so I'm slowly adding the missing items manually as local files. 

Given the popularity of Spotify, it deels like the absence of an album from Spotify is one possible measure of its obscurity...

## Jean-Michel Jarre

| Year | Album |
| ---- | ----- |
| 2002 | Sessions 2000 | Jarre's 14th studio album | 
| 2004 | Aero | A compilation album with three new tracks and new connecting pieces. |
| 2006 | Téo & Téa | Jarre's 16th studio album | 
| 2015 | Essential recollection | A compilation album from 1976-2000, remastered in 2014 |

It also doesn't contain the 2015 Essential Recollection compilation, but as that's a compilation with no new tracks, I built a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0CFvy5M66KMnHfR4ZHOV2Y?si=8727224068ee4d80).
