    <h2>Description</h2> Test-potentiated learning experiment
    examining recall performance, reported
    in <a href = "">Seabrooke, Hollins, Wills, Mitchell
    (submitted)</a>, Experiment 2.  This DAU contains raw data and
    analysis scripts, in open cross-platform formats (see the
      <a href = "../formats.html">file format notes</a>). The raw data
      file also contains the full set of stimulus items, as the
      stimuli presented on each trial are recorded (see below).

      <ul>
        <li><a href = "TPL2_LongData.csv">TPL2_LongData.csv</a>
          (445 KB) - Trial-level raw data.Column headings are as
          follows:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Subject - Participant number, unique to ply129</li>
	    <li>Experiment - Experiment name</li>
	    <li>Group - Counterbalancing condition for order of
	      encoding phases (e.g., Study, First Word, Meaning)</li>
	    <ol>
	      <li>S,M,F</li>
	      <li>S,F,M</li>
	      <li>M,S,F</li>
	      <li>M,F,S</li>
	      <li>F,S,M</li>
	      <li>F,M,S</li>
	    </ol>
	    <li>Age - Age of participant (in years) </li>
	    <li>Gender - Gender of pariticipant (female, male)</li>
	    <li>Running - Combines phase and w/subj condition of
	      experiment. [Study, Meaning, First Word] indicate an
	      encoding trial in the corresponding
	      condition. [Recall] indicates a cued recall trial.</li>
	    <li>Condition - In the recall phase, the encoding
	      condition under which the word was presented. In the
	      encoding phase, set to NA.</li>
	    <li>Cycle - Recall test number. Always set to one in the
	    encoding phase.</li>
	    <li>Sample - Within-phase trial number (resets at the
	      beginning of each new encoding phase, continues from previous cued
	      recall phase).</li>
	    <li>Cue - In the encoding phase, the presented cue word. In the recall phase,
	      the presented retrieval cue.</li>
	    <li>Target - The presented target word.</li>
	    <li>Acc - Whether the participant's response is correct
	      (1) or incorrect (0). In the Study condition of the encoding phase,
	      set to NA. In cued recall, the word must match letter-for-letter in
	      order to be coded as 1.</li>
	    <li>Resp - The participant's response.</li>
	    <li>RT - The time (in ms) from onset of the cue to the
	      participant pressing the last key. In the Study condition of encoding
	      phase, set to NA.</li>
	  </ul>

	  need <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>. You will
	  also need to have installed the following packages that are
	  available on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>:
	  ez, ggplot2, pastecs, plyr.
