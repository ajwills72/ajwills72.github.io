		Data and Analysis Unit: KULMAES2</h1>
		<i>Last update: 2015-05-15 by Andy Wills</i><p>

		<h2>Description</h2>
		Human discrimination task, reported as Experiment 1B in Maes et al.

		This DAU contains stimuli, trial-level raw data, and an analysis script, all  in open
		cross-platform formats (see the <a href = "../formats.html">file format notes</a>).
		It also provides some informal resources for running experiments like this within
		the experiment generator Affect 4.0.

		<p><b>UPDATE:</b> The sex, age, course,
		and year columns of kulmaes2data.txt have had all their data replaced with the word 'deleted'.
		This is in response to concerns about the potential non-anonymity of biographical data when pooled.
		All queries regarding these columns should be directed to Elisa Maes or Tom Beckers.
