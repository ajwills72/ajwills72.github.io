		<h2>Description</h2>	
		Category learning task, reported in Experiment 4B of Wills, Inkster, and Milton (submitted).		
		
		This DAU contains raw data, and an analysis script, in open 
		cross-platform formats (see the <a href = "../formats.html">file format notes</a>). Stimulus
		files and instrutctions were identical to PLYM5, and links to those resources are also given below.

		Column headings are as follows:
			<ul>
					<li>subj: Participant ID (unique within PLYM6)
					<li>cond: Experimental condition (1 = intentional, 2 = incidental)
					<li>cb: Stimulus randomization condition (1-8, see plym6cb.txt)

					<li>phase: Experiment phase (1 = training, 2 = test)
					<li>blk: Block (Ranges from 1 to 3 in phase 1, and 1 to 13 in phase 2)
					<li>trial: Trial number (resets for each block)
					<li>stim: Stimulus ID (see plym6code.txt)
					<li>resp: Phase-specific response code
					<ul>
						<li>Training phase, Intentional condition:  	Accuracy ( 1 = right, 0 = wrong )
						<li>Training phase, Incidental condition: Choice ( 1 = seen before, 0 = not seen )
						<li>Test phase (either condition): Choice ( 1 = the 1111 category, 0 = the 0000 category	)			
					</ul>
					<li>rt: Reaction time in milliseconds
					<li>conf: 	Confidence rating (1-3: 1 = 'not confident', 2 = 'neither confident nor unconfident', 
					3 = 'confident'). Only used in the training phase of the incidental condition. Set to zero otherwise.
					<li>confrt: Reaction time in milliseconds for the confidence rating. 
					Only used in the training phase of the incidental condition. Set to zero otherwise.

			<li><a href = "plym6analysis.R">plym6analysis.R</a>  (1 KB) -  R script for analyses 
	reported in Wills, Inkster, Milton (submitted). This script can be run by the command 
	source('plym6analysis.R'), or can be run interactively. Requires plym6cap.R
		
		<li><a href = "plym6cap.R">plym6cap.R</a>  (6 KB) -  R script containing a single function that
		performs all analyses required in PLYM6. This allows variant analyses (e.g. with 
		or without participant exclusions) to be run without code duplication. This is
		NOT a portable function, it makes use of global variables and will only work unmodified in the context of these
		specific experiments. 
		
		<li><a href = "plym6code.txt">plym6code.txt</a> - The main purpose of this file is to facilitate
		automated analysis of plym6data.txt by plym6analysis.R. Column headings 
		are as follows:
		<ul>
			<li>stim.number: Stimulus ID (as used in plym6data.txt)

			<li>stim.type: Logical stimulus code. The four digits are the values of the four stimulus dimensions 
			(left to right, D1-D4). The final 's' has no meaning, it's there to ensure the four digits are parsed by R scripts as
			a string rather than as a number.  In all stimulus randomization conditions, 
			the stim.type code (and thus also the stimulus ID) represents the stimulus
			in canonical form (i.e. with D1 as criterial, D2-D4 as noncriterial, and with 1111 and 0000 as
			the category prototypes).  Thus stimulus ID 1-4 are category 1111 training stimuli, ID 5-8 are
			category 0000 training stimuli, ID 9-10 are the 'critical' test stimuli.
			
			<li>fr: The response predicted by an Overall Similarity response model (1 = category 1111, 
			0 = category 0000, 0.5 = no prediction).	
			<li>ca: The response predicted by a Critierial Attribute response model.
			<li>nca1: The response predicted by a Noncriterial Attribute response model acting on D2
			<li>nca2: The response predicted by a Noncriterial Attribute response model acting on D3		
			<li>nca3: The response predicted by a Noncriterial Attribute response model acting on D4
			<li>lk: The response predicted by an 'alway press the left key' response model.
			<li>rk: The response predicted by an 'alway press the right key' response model.		
		</ul>	
		
		<li><a href = "plym6cb.txt">plym6cb.txt</a> (1 KB) - Specification of stimulus randomization
		conditions. Each column represents one of the 16 conditions (cb in plym6data.txt). Each
		row represents a stimulus ID (stim in plym6data.txt). Each cell gives the filename of the 
		physical stimulus presented	for a particular cb condition and stimulus ID. For example, 
		1010 indicates stimulus file 1010.png in plym6stim.tbz.
		
		<i>Note: </i> The column
		titles (e.g. "cb5:R2D34") give the value of cb (5 in this example) and then describe the operation
		required to get from the canonical structure (cb = 1) to this structure. "R" means rotate. Specifically,
		R1 means rotate left once i.e. all four digits in the stimulus code move one place to the left, with the leftmost digit
		becoming the rightmost digit. R2 means two left-rotate operations. After the rotations one or
		more of the dimensions are flipped (all 1s become 0s and all 0s become 1s). For example, D3D4 means 
		flip D3 and D4, after rotation.
