Lee studies addictive behaviours at the School of Psychology, University of Exeter. He was previously a senior lecturer at UNSW, a lecturer at Nottingham, a research fellow at Sussex, and a Ph.D. student at Cambridge (where we met). At some point during his time at Nottingham, I suggested an idea for an experiment.
