Emmanuel works on computational modelling of cognitive processes at the Department of Psychology, City University of London, where he was previously Head of School. We first met at a Cognitive Science Society conference in the late 90s, and started working together when we co-edited a book on the computational modelling of categorization (Pothos & Wills, 2011).
