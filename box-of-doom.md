# Box of Doom

The 'box of doom' is the mechanism for selecting speakers at our fortnightly research meeting, previously known as 'Learning Lunch', now known as the 'CaLM lunch' (Categorization, Learning, Memory). The idea is that the talk is unprepared, so the selection happens once the meeting starts. 

We've been doing this since about 2013, but I only got around to recording who spoke when late in 2021.
