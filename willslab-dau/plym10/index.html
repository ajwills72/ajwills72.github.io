<h2>Simulation</h2>

This section contains a description of, and source code for, the
simulation reported in Figure 1 of O'Connell et al. (submitted).

<h3>Description</h3>

<!-- NULL, blocks to run network on all zeros input and category,

-->

The model architecture and parameters were as specified in Gluck and
Myers (1993, Appendix), with the following exceptions: (a) in the
current experiment, there was an outcome on every training trial
(category A or category B), thus the US-present learning rate was used
on all training trials, (b) input-to-hidden connections in the
cortical model had a learning rate of 0.1, (c) weights were intialized
to a [-3,+3] random uniform distribution.

<p>The model had 24 units representing the stimuli (one for each
icon), 12 hidden units, and 2 units representing the outcome (one for
each category label). Activation from the outcome units was converted
to a response probability using a standard exponential ratio decision
mechanism (see e.g. Wills et al., 2000). This decision mechanism's
single parameter (k) was arbitrarily set to 3; the conclusions of this
simulation are robust to a wide range of values for k.

<p>The model was trained and tested on the same number of trials as
were the participants, with the stimuli generated using the same
algorithms as the program which ran the experiment. As is standard in
applications of the Gluck-Myers model, training was preceded by 500
blank trials (ie. no stimuli and no category label), in order to
initialize the network.

<p>Figure 1 of O'Connell et al. (submitted) is an average across 2000
simulated participants, each with a different set of randomly-selected
initial weights.The simulation was conducted largely in C, for speed
of execution, with non-time-critical collation and graphing performed
in R. The source code for this simulation is provided below.

<li><u>analysis.R</u> - <b>Run this one</b> - R script that compiles
the simulation from C source code, performs 2000 runs of the
simulation, calculates the average ouput from these runs, and presents
outputs results as a graph in a PDF file ('bigsum.pdf')

<p>In order to run this simulation, you will need to install the
following:
<ul>
<li><a href = "http://www.r-project.org/about.html">R</a> - a free
software environment for statistical computing and graphics.
<li><a href = "http://gcc.gnu.org//">gcc</a> - a free compiler. If you
did a full install of R, you probably have this already.
</ul>
<p>This simulation was conducted on a Linux machine. It should work
with little or no modification on any UNIX-based system (including
Apple's OS X). For MS Windows, you may have to modify
the <i>system()</i> calls in <i>analysis.R</i> - happy to help you do
this, on request.

<h2>Empirical data and analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

This section publishes such participant data files as are permitted
under the ethical and regulatory approvals governing the research
reported in O'Connell et al. (submitted).  Analysis scripts and
stimulus image files are also provided.

<h3>Resources</h3>

<ul>
<li><u>plym10pat.csv</u> (6K) - Participant-level raw data for patient
group and matched control group. Legal/ethical issues mean this raw
data cannot be published. It may be possible to provide a confidential
copy for research purposes on request - contact me. Column headings
are as follows:
<ul>
<li>subj: Participant number (unique within PLYM10)
<li>grp: Experiment condition (exp = patient group, ctrl = match
controls)
<li>datum: Specifies type of data presented in the current row:
<ul>
<li>ph1error: Training phase error score.
<li>a12 ... a0: Number of category A elements in the test stimulus.
<li>age: Participant's age.
</ul>
<li>value: Dependent on value of 'datum':
<ul>
<li> where datum = 'ph1error': Number incorrect responses in training phase
<li> where datum = 'age': Participant's age at time of testing, in years.
<li> otherwise: Number of 'category A' responses during test phase.
</ul> 
</ul>

<li><a href =

group</b>. Column headings are as follows:
<ul>
<li>date: Date of testing.
<li>subj: Participant number (unique within PLYM10).
<li>phase: Experiment phase. 1 = training, 2 = test.
<li>trial: Trial number (resets between phases).
<li>stim: Phase specific:
<ul>
<li>Phase 1: The category from which the training item was generated.
<li>Phase 2: Number of category B elements (0-12).

source('plym10analysis.R'), or can be run interactively. It also
produces Figure 2C as a PDF. In addition to the two following files,
you will need to have installed the R packages <i>ez</i>
