This is an experiment about categorisation Ð our ability to divide the world into groups of things. Pictures will appear on the screen one at a time. For each picture, you have to decide whether it belongs to category A or category B. If you think that the picture belongs to category A, press the X key.If you think that the picture belongs to category B, press the > key.Obviously you will be guessing at first. Do not worry about this. After each decision you make, the computer will tell you whether you were right or not. It will also state the name of the correct category (e.g. ÒIt was category AÓ). Your task is to learn from this information and achieve 100% accuracy consistently.  Please note that the amount of time you take to categorise each picture is NOT important.There will be a very large number of pictures presented in this experiment. After 32 pictures have been presented, the computer will pause. This is the end of a block, not the end of the experiment. At the end of each block, you should rest for a few seconds Ð look away from the screen and stretch your fingers. When you are ready to continue, press the SPACE bar.At the end of each block, the computer will let you know how well you did on the last 32 pictures (e.g. 74% correct). Remember that you are aiming for 100%.From time to time, the computer may run a short test of your learning. Thirty pictures will be presented one at a time and you will have to make decisions as before, but you will not be told whether your answers are right or wrong. You should try not to be put off by this, it is important that you attempt to score 100% on this test.As the test continues, the pictures presented may get more complex. You may find that the information you have gained in the early parts of the experiment helps you with these more complex pictures.
