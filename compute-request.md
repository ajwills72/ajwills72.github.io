# BRIC compute request pump-prime form

_Date of request_: 21-Jan-2022

_Financial year of expenditure_: 2021/2

_Requested amount_ (GBP): 650

_Requested by_: Lenard Dome, Andy Wills

_Technical purpose_: Massive [Parameter Space Partioning](https://www.andywills.info/2021-06-23-psp) exploration of the predictions of [computational models of category learning](https://www.andywills.info/catlearn). Links are to open-source software we have developed for this work.

_Explanation of cost_: Calculations shown [here](https://gist.github.com/lenarddome/8d0905edaa62037717832a30e1d9d269) estimate £275 for one of the heaviest simulations we need to run. There will be at least two of these, plus some smaller work. £650 should cover it. 

_Benefit to BRIC_: Capacity building towards grant application. Simulations needed for high-profile methods paper (target submission: Summer 2022). This work important as a proof-of-concept for our computational neuroscience grant application (target submission: Autumn 2022). 

_Track record_:
