		<h2>Description</h2>	
		Contingency learning experiment with concurrent load, reported by Lee et al. (in prep.)

		This DAU contains raw data, and an analysis script, in open 
		cross-platform formats (see the <a href = "../formats.html">file format notes</a>).

					<li>cb: Order of test phases (1 = contingency tests then SRT tests, 2 = vice versa ) ???
					<li>age: Age of participant in years.
					<li>gender: Gender of participant ('m' or 'M' =male, 'f' or 'F'=female)
					<li>hand: Handedness of participant ('l' or 'L'=lefthanded, 'r' or 'R' or 'right'=righthanded)
					<li>block: Training block (ranges from 1 to 6)
					<li>trial: Trial number (does NOT reset for each block)
					<li>stimtype: ID for abstract stimulus type 
					(1=A, 2=B, 3=AB;

					 22 = MN;
					 23 = O, 24 = P)
					 <li>stim1: ID for abstract stimulus type presented on the left (or the only stimulus presented
					 on element trials e.g. A). Coding is DIFFERENT to coding of stimtype. It is:
					 1=A,2=B,3=C,4=D,5=E,6=F,7=G,8=H,9=I,10=J
					 ,11=K,12=L,13=M,14=N,15=O,16=P).
										 
					 <li>stim2: ID for abstract stimulus type presented on the right (set to zero on 
					 element trials e.g. A). Uses the same coding scheme as stim1.
					 <li>outcome: Outcome of the trial (1=win, 2=no win)
					 <li>resp: Participant's response (1= 'bet 1 Australian Dollar', 2 = 'bet AUS 20', 3 = 'best AUS 100')
					 <li>rt: Participant's reaction time in seconds.
					 <li>acc: How much the participant lost or won on this trial, in Australian dollars.
