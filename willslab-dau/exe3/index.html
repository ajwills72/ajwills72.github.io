		<h2>Description</h2>	
		Pigeon go-left, go-right, visual discrimination task, reported in Maes et al. (in prep.)
		
		This DAU contains stimulus files, raw data, and an analysis script, in open 
		cross-platform formats (see the <a href = "../formats.html">file format notes</a>).

		<ul>
		<li><a href = "exe3stim.tbz">exe3stim.tbz</a> (50 KB) - Stimulus image files 
		<li><a href = "exe3data.txt">exe3data.txt</a> (2.7 MB) - Trial-level raw data. 
		Column headings are as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>subj: Bird ID number (unique within EXE3). 1 = "At", 2 = "Ax", 3 = "Bw", 
				4 = "Fe", 5 = "He", 6 = "Mo", 7 = "Ta"
				<li>phase.name: Experiment phase ("T1", "T2", "T3", "T4", "T5"). Note 1: In one session
				for Bird 2, and one session for Bird 4, the T3 procedure was accidentally run 
				during another phase - phase.name is set to 'ErrorT3' for these sessions. 
				<li>date: Date of session (in YYYY-MM-DD format)
				<li>time: 1 = first session on that date, 2 = second session on that date.
				<li>sess: Session number (resets for each phase)
				<li>trial: Trial number (resets for each session). Note 2: A few sessions have fewer trials than
				expected - this is due to birds occasionally ceasing to peck before session end. Note 3: A few 
				sessions have more trials than expected - this is due to experimenter error. These sessions
				contain the appropriate trial types for the phase, just slightly too many of them.
				<li>stimtype: Logical stimulus type, as referred to in Maes et al. (in prep.)
				<li>stim: Filename of physical stimulus presented, as in exe3stim.tbz
				<li> trialtype: L+ = go-left trial. R+ = go-right trial. 
				<li> acc: 1 = First peck is correct; 0 = First peck is incorrect.
			</ul>
			<li><a href = "exe3analysis.R">exe3analysis.R</a>  (3 KB) -  R script for analyses 
	reported in Maes et al. (in prep.). This script can be run by the command 
	source('exe3analysis.R'), or can be run interactively.
