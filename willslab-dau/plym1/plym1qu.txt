I plan tasks carefullyI do things without thinkingI make up my mind quicklyI am happy go luckyI don't pay attentionI have racing thoughtsI plan trips well ahead of timeI am self-controlledI concentrate easilyI save regularlyI squirm during plays or lecturesI am a careful thinkerI plan for job securityI say things without thinkingI like to think about complex problemsI change jobs regularlyI act on impulseI get easily bored when solving thought problemsI act on the spur of the momentI am a steady thinkerI change residence frequentlyI buy things on impulseI can only think about one problem at a timeI change hobbiesI spend or charge more than I earnI often have extraneous thoughts when thinkingI am more interested in the present than in the futureI am restless at the theatre or lecturesI like puzzlesI am future oriented
