Charlotte works at Queen Mary, University of London, on a DSTL-funded project on communicating uncertainty, and is also a Visiting Fellow at Warwick Business School. I supervised her undergraduate dissertation at Exeter, and then her Ph.D. at Plymouth; both on category learning and the computational modelling thereof.
