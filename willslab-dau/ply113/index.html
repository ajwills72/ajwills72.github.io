    <h2>Description</h2> Test-potentiated learning experiment
    examining both recognition and recall performance, reported
    in <a href = "">Seabrooke, Hollins, Wills, Mitchell
    (submitted)</a>, Experiment 1.  This DAU contains raw data and
    analysis scripts, in open cross-platform formats (see the
      <a href = "../formats.html">file format notes</a>). The raw data
      file also contains the full set of stimulus items, as the
      stimuli presented on each trial are recorded (see below).

      <ul>
        <li><a href = "PLY113longData.csv">PLY113longData.csv</a>
          (1.3MB) - Trial-level raw data.Column headings are as
          follows:</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Subject - Participant number, unique to ply113</li>
	    <li>Sex - Gender of pariticipant (female, male)</li>
	    <li>Age - Age of participant (in years) </li>
	    <li>Group - b/subj condition of experiment (Recognition,
	      Recall)</li>
	    <li>Running - Combines phase and w/subj condition of
	      experiment. [Study, Meaning, First Word] indicate an
	      encoding trial in the corresponding
	      condition. [Recognition, Recall] indicates a retrieval
	      trial of the corresponding type.</li>
	    <li>Sample - Within-phase trial number (resets at the
	      beginning of each new encoding phase, and at beginning
	      of retrieval phase).</li>
	    <li>Cue - In the encoding phase, the presented cue
	      word. In the recognition phase, the presented word
	      (which could be either a cue or a target). In the recall
	      phase, the presented retrieval cue.</li>
	    <li>Target - In the encoding phase, the presented target
	      word. In the retrieval phase, set to NA.</li>
	    <li>Acc - Whether the participant's response is correct
	      (1) or incorrect (0). In the Study condition of the encoding phase,
	      set to NA. In cued recall, the word must match letter-for-letter in
	      order to be coded as 1.</li>
	    <li>RT - The time (in ms) from onset of the cue to the
	      participant pressing the key (the last key in the cued recall test).
	      In the Sudy condition of encoding phase, set to NA.</li>
	    <li>Resp - The participant's response.</li>
	    <li>Condition - In the retrieval phase, the encoding
	      condition under which the word was presented. Words not in the
	      encoding condition are described as 'Foil'. In the encoding phase, set
	      to NA</li>
	    <li>WordType - Whether the word presented in the retrieval
	      phase was a cue (rare word) or a target (definition) in the encoding
	      phase. In the encoding phase, set to NA.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <li>R scripts for analysis of PL113. You will
	  need <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>. You will
	  also need to have installed the following packages that are
	  available on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>:
	  cowplot, ez, ggplot2, pastecs, plyr, pwr, psych, Rmisc</li>

	    <li><a href="tpl1functions.R">tpl1functions.R</a> -
	    functions required by the other scripts, below.</li>

            statistical analysis reported in the mansucript.</li>
