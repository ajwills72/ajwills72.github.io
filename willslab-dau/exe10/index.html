Data and Analysis Unit: EXE10</h1>

<h2>Description</h2> fMRI contingency learning experiment, based on
the Shanks-Darby procedure.  This DAU contains raw data, and an
analysis script, in open cross-platform formats (see the <a href =
"../formats.html">file format notes</a>).

<li><a href = "exe10sots.zip">exe10sots.zip</a> - <b>Updated
  2016-09-26</b>, now matches published paper. Archive
containing stimulus onset time files required for fMRI analysis; one
per participant. The files are in <i>.mat</i> format.  Each file
contains the vectors listed below. Each vector contains a set of
stimulus onset times, expressed in seconds from the beginning of the
run. Where a vector would otherwise be empty (e.g. for a participant
who had no timeout trials), the vector contains a single onset time,
set to a value after the end of the run (equal to, or greater than,
770 seconds).
<ul>
<li><i>training.1.correct</i>:
  Trials during training phase, run 1, on which the participant

  Trials during the test phase, on which a familiar stimulus

<li><i>critical.correct</i>: 
  Trials for critical test items in which the response is consistent with
  rule-based generalization (see Milton et al., submitted).

  Trials during the test phase in which the participant made no response.

<li><a href = "exe10data.txt">exe10data.txt</a>  - 
Trial-level behavioural raw data. Column headings are as follows:
<ul>
<li>date: Date paricipant was tested (in MM-DD-YYYY format)
<li>cond: Experimental condition ( "rule" - rule instructions;
 "sim" - similarity instructions).
<li>cb: Counterbalance condition (see exe10code.csv).
<li>subj: Participant ID (unique within EXE10).
<li>phase: Experiment phase (1 = training, 2 = test)
<li>blk: Block (Range 1-10; does not reset between phases).
<li>trial: Trial number (resets for each block)
<li>stim: Presented stimulus (e.g. 'cheese and garlic')
<li>resp: Participant's response to presented meal 
( 0 = No reaction , 1 = Reaction, -1 = timed out )
<li>cresp: Correct response.
<li>rt: Participant's reaction time to presented meal in millisecond
 ( 0 = timed out)
<li>stim2: Stimulus ID number (see exe10code.csv, 'stim' column).
</ul>
		
<li><a href = "exe10code.csv">exe10code.csv</a>  - 
Shows mapping from food stimulus
ID ('stim2' in exe10data.txt), physical food names,
 and logical food labels (A,B, etc). The last
of these is contingent on counter-blance condition. Column headings
are as follows:
<ul>
<li>stim: Stimulus ID number (used in exe10data.txt)
<li>Food: Physical food name(s) presented
<li> CB1code: Logical food labels (A,B,...) where in first 
counterbalance condition (cb=1 in exe10data.txt)
<li> CB1type: Logical food category where in first counterbalance
 condition. Categories are as follows:
<ul>
<li> famP: 'familiar positive' i.e. item present during training 
that is followed by an allergic reaction.
<li> famN: 'familiar negative'
<li> MN, OP, K/L, O/P: As described in Wills et al. (2011).
</ul>
<li> CB1corr: Correct response where cb=1 (0 = No reaction, 
1 = Reaction). For novel test items,
correct = the rule-based response (e.j. 0 for IJ)
<li> CB2code: As CB1code for cb = 2
<li> CB2type: As CB1type for cb = 2
<li> CB2corr: As CB1corr for cb = 2
</ul>

<li><a href = "exe10analysis.R">exe10analysis.R</a> - R script

Bayes Factor calculations as per Dienes (2011). Ported to R by Baugely
