		<h2>Description</h2>	
		Match-to-standards classification task with instructional manipulation,
		 reported in Wills et al. (2013, QJEP, Experiment 4).
		This DAU contains stimulus files, raw data,
		and an analysis script, in open 
		cross-platform formats (see the <a href = "../formats.html">file format notes</a>)

		<h2>Resources</h2>
		<ul>
		<li><a href = "../exe8/exe8stim.tbz">exe8stim.tbz</a> (44 KB) - Stimulus image files (from EXE8).
		<li><a href = "exe8data.csv">exe9data.csv</a> (83 KB) - Trial-level raw data. Column headings are as follows:
			<ul>			
				<li>cond: Experimental condition 
				<li>subj: Participant number (unique within EXE9)
				<li>block: Experiment block 
				<li>trial: Trial number (resets between blocks)
				<li>stim: The to-be-classified stimulus presented, numbers refer to stimulus file names in exe8stim.tbz
				<li>resp: Participant's classification response (A = category A, B = category B) 
				<li>rt: Participant's reaction time for classification response (in milliseconds)
			</ul>
			
		<li><a href = "exe9classic.csv">exe8classic.csv</a> (1  KB) - Subject-level raw data for the classic "combined"
		analysis used in match-to-standard tasks. This is where each block is classified as UD, OS, or Other, on the basis of
		both the objective sort produced, and the participant's description of that sort (see paper for details). Participants' 
		descriptions were not archived for this study.
						
		<li><a href = "exe9analysis.R">exe9analysis.R</a>  (4 KB) -  R script for the analyses of Wills et al. (2013, QJEP).
