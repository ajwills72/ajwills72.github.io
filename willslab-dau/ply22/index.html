    <h1>Data and Analysis Unit: PLY22</h1>
    <i>Last update: 2017-05-08 by Andy Wills</i><p>
      
      <h2>Description</h2>
      Experiment investigating the effect of training order on
      category learning performance reported in
      <a href = "">Edmunds, Wills, Milton (2017)</a>, Experiment 1.
      This DAU contains stimulus image files, raw data, and analysis
      scripts, all in open cross-platform formats (see the
      <a href = "../formats.html">file format notes</a>).
      
      <h2>Resources</h2>
      <ul>
	<li><a href = "PLY22stimuli.zip">PLY22stimuli.zip</a> (3.9 MB)
	  - Stimulus image files. </li>
	
        <li><a href = "PLY22longData.csv">PLY22longData.csv</a> (845
          KB) - Trial-level raw data. This is the file against which
          the md5 checksum reported in the journal article is
          calculated. Column headings are as follows:

	  <ul>
	    <li>DAU: Experiment name </li>

	    <li>Participant: Participant ID (unique across entire
	      experiment)</li>

	    <li>Condition: Experimental condition (either EasyMed or
	    HardMed)</li>
	    
            <li>Block: Block number</li>
	    
            <li>SubBlock: Values from 1 to 5 that change every 30
            trials to aid with learning curve graphs</li>
	    
            <li>Trial: Trial number</li>
	    
            <li>StimulusNo: Unique ID for each stimulus (number
            corresponds to numbered PNG files in PLY22stimuli.zip)</li>
	 
            <li>Frequency: The value of each stimulus on the spatial
            frequency dimension (in arbitrary units)</li>
	    
            <li>Orientation: The value of each stimulus on the
            orientation dimension (in arbitrary units)</li>
	    
            <li>Category: The category assignment for each stimulus
            (Category A=0 and Category B=1)</li>
	    
            <li>Difficulty: The difficulty of that stimulus (Easy,
            Med, Hard)</li>

            <li>Response: The response the participant gave (Category
            A=68, Category B=75; numbers refer to ASCII code of
            response letters on keyboard i.e. 68 = key 'D', 75 = key
            'K')</li>
	    
            <li>Correct: Whether the participant was correct or not
            (0 = incorrect, 1 = correct)</li>
	    
            <li>RT: Reaction time in seconds</li>
	    
	  </ul>

	<li><a href="PLY22verbalReports.pdf">PLY22verbalReports.pdf</a>
	(1.7 MB) - Scanned copies of the strategy reports produced by
	each participant. Prefix participant numbers with '22' to
	match up to the other files in this repository
	(e.g. participant 103 in this file is participant 22103 in the
	other files). </li>

	<li><a href="PLY22verbalReports.csv">PLY22verbalReports.csv</a>
	(1 KB) - Participant level strategy information from verbal
	reports given by participants. Column headings are as follows:

	  <ul>
            <li>Participant: Participant ID</li>
	    
            <li>Condition: Experimental condition (1 =
              Easy-to-medium, 2 = Hard-to-medium)</li>

            Williams</li>
	    
            <li>Agreed: Classification of participant's strategy
            agreed by CERE and GW after discussion. For this and the
            previous two columns the codes are:
	      
	      <ul>

		<li>2D = Generic two-dimensional rule</li>

		<li>CJ=Conjunction rule</li>

		<li>CJ2 = A double conjunction</li>

		<li>NA = No relevant strategy information</li>

		<li>RuleX = Rule plus exception</li>

		<li>SUR = Sequential unidimensional rules</li>

		<li>Udexp = Unidimensional rule plus exception</li>
		
		<li>UDF = Unidimensional rule based on frequency</li>

		<li>UDO = Unidimensional rule based on
		orientation</li>

	      </ul>
		
            <li>CEREyes: Whether CERE thought the participant reported
            a strategy or not (1 = yes, 0 = no)</li>
	    
            <li>GWyes: Whether GW thought participants reported a
              strategy or not (1 = yes, 0 = no)</li>

	    <li>AgreedYes: Presence of straetgy agreed by CERE and GW
	    after discussion (1 = yes, 0 - no)</li>
	    
            <li>simpStrat: Simplified strategies. All complex
            rule-based strategies are given the label "Complex", and
            both unidimensional strategies are defined as "UD"</li>
