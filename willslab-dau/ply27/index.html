		<a href = "PLY27.csv">PLY27.csv</a> (1 MB) - Trial-level raw data. 
		Column headings are as follows:
			<ul>
					<li>Participant: Participant Number.					
					<li>Condition: 1=Conjunction-Feedback training, 2=Conjunction-Observational training. 			
					<li>Block: Block number from 1 to 10.
					<li>Phase: Experiment phase (1=Training, 2=Test).
					<li>Trial: Trial number (does not reset for each block).
					<li>Stimulus: Arbitrary, stimulus-unique, ID code.
					<li>Length: Stimulus length measured in pixels.
					<li>Orientation: Stimulus orientation in arbitrary coordinates. They were converted into angles measured in radians, anti-clockwise from East, by applying a scaling factor of pi/500. 
					<li>Category: Correct category assignment for each stimulus (1=Category A, 2=Category B).
					<li>Response: The response on each trial (68=Category A, 75=Category B).
					<li>Correct: Whether the response was correct or not (1=Correct, 0=Incorrect).
			</ul>
					<a href = "PLY27Verbal.csv">PLY27Verbal.csv</a> (<1 KB) - Verbal report data for each participant.
		Column headings are as follows:
			<ul>
					<li>Participant: Participant Number.		
					<li>Condition: 1-Feedback training, 2-Observation training
					<li>Strategy: UDL-unidimensional length, UDO-unidmiensional orientation, CJ-upper-left conjunction, CJ2-specified both upper-left and lower-right conjunctions, 2D-mentioned both stimulus dimensions, O-other.
					<li>Confidence: Answer to the question 'how sure are you that your strategy is the best one'. Likert scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (Certain).
			</ul>
					<a href = "PLY27Verbal.pdf">PLY27Verbal.pdf</a> (1.7 MB) - Verbal report data for each participant. Participant code in top left hand corner. Those beginning with 2 were in the feedback training condition, 3 in the observational training condition.
