<ul>
  <li><a href='exe13clar.txt'>exe13clar.txt</a> (3 KB) - Some
    clarifications of the Method and Results of this experiment.
    
  <li><a href='../exe11/exe11stims.tar.bz2'>exe11stims.tar.bz2</a>
  (705 KB) - Stimulus image files. Filenames are of the form
  'A8----x.png', where '----' is the four-digit code used in the raw
  data file (see below). 'A8' is an irrelevant prefix, 'x' is an
  irrelevant single-digit suffix. These are the same files as used in
  EXE11 (Exp. 1B in Wills et al. (2009).
    
  <li><a href='exe13analysis.R'>exe13analysis.R</a> (9 KB) - R script
  replicating and updating the central results of Experiment 1A
  reported in Wills et al. (2009).

  <li><a href = "exe13data.csv">exe13data.csv</a> (3.1 MB) -
    Trial-level behavioural raw data. Column headings are as follows:
    
    <ul>
      
      <li><b>date</b>: Date of testing session (in YYYY-MM-DD format)

      <li><b>subj</b>: Two letter bird-identifying code (e.g.
      "As"). Codes correspond to those used in Wills et al. (2009,
      Exp. 1A).

      <li><b>keyb</b>: Response counterbalance condition. There are
	two conditions, 'left' and 'right'.

      <li><b>phase</b>: Experiment phase:
	<ol>
	  <li> Single-dimension training
	  <li> Prototype training
	  <li> Test phase 1
	  <li> Reacqusition phase 1
	  <li> Test phase 2
	  <li> Reacqusition phase 2
	  <li> Test phase 3
	  <li> Reacqusition phase 3
	  <li> Test phase 4
	  <li> Reacqusition phase 4
	  <li> Test phase 5
	  <li> Reacqusition phase 5
	  <li> Test phase 6
	</ol>
     <li><b>sess</b>: Session number.
     <li><b>trial:</b> Trial number; resets at start of each session.
</ul>
<li><b>snum</b>: <i>Do not use this column</i>. It contains errors - see 
exe13clar.txt.
<li><b>stim</b>: Four-digit code for physically-presented stimulus
(same codes as for EXE11 ie. Wills et al. (2009, Exp
1B). Phase-specific:
<ul>
  <li>Phase 1: Single-attribute stimuli. Counting from the left: </li>
  <ul>
    <li>1st digit: bar: 0 = absent, 1 = long, 2 = short </li> 
    <li>2nd digit: checks: 0 = absent, 1 = coarse, 2 = fine </li> 
    <li>3rd digit: doughnut: 0 = absent, 1 = large, 2 = small </li> 
    <li>4th digit: lozenge: 0 = absent, 1 = convex, 2 = concave </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Phases 2-3: Three-attribute stimuli. Counting from the left,
  the digits refer to physical locations within this stimulus: </li>
  <ul>
    <li>1st digit: top stimulus attribute</li>
    <li>2nd digit: left stimulus attribute</li>
    <li>3rd digit: right stimulus attribute</li>
    <li>4th digit: Always zero</li>
  </ul>
  The numbers at each location mean the following:
  <ul>
    <li>1: lozenge: convex</li>
    <li>2: doughnut: large</li>
    <li>3: bar: long</li>
    <li>4: checks: coarse</li>
    <li>5: lozenge: concave</li>
    <li>6: doughnut: small</li>
    <li>7: bar: short</li>
    <li>8: checks: fine</li>
  </ul>
  <li> Where a session is empty or missing (see below), stim is set to
  'S' or 'SNA'.
</ul>

<li><b>vtft: </b> The time interval (in seconds) between onset of the
response stimuli and the time at which the participant's responses
have a scheduled consequence (i.e. are not ignored).</li>

 <li><b>ftpks: </b> The number of responses made by the participant
during the vtft interval. </li>
<li><b>pk1acc:</b> The status of the first response made by the
participant to the response stimulus after the vtft interval (see
above) had expired. Depends on stimulus type:</li>
<ul>
<li>Training stimuli: </li>  
<ul>
  <li>* : correct response</li>
  <li>+ : Incorrect response</li>
  <li>$ : No response made after the vtft interval</li>
</ul>
<li>Test stimuli: </li>
<ul>
  <li>L : response on left key</li>
  <li>R : response on right key</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<li><b>totpks: </b> The total number of responses made by the
participant to the response stimulus after the vtft interval (see
above) had expired.

<li><b>pos1rt: </b>The latency of the first left-key response to the
response stimulus, measured from response stimulus onset
(i.e. includes ignored responses). -1 indicates no responses of this
type on this trial. </li>

<li><b>neg1rt: </b>The latency of the first right-key response to the
response stimulus, measured from response stimulus onset
(i.e. includes ignored responses). -1 indicates no responses of this
type on this trial. </li>

<li><b>fc: </b> Normally empty, if there is a character in this field,
it indicates the following:
<ul>
  <li>F : A forced-choice trial (i.e. the trial does not end until the
bird makes the correct response). There is no entry in <b>pk1acc</b>
for these trials.</li>

  <li>empty : A session for which the bird was placed in the testing 
chamber but no responses were emitted.</li>

  <li>missing : A session for which the data was not recorded.</li>

  <li>fault : A session during which one or both of the food delivery
hoppers malfunctioned. The reinforcment of the birds in these sessions
is thus not according to the schedule and may be largely absent.

</ul>

<li><b>pz1</b> : Number of pecks to stimulus zone 1 (top) during the
observing response. Meaningless for single-element stimuli of phase 1,
and hence recorded as -1 for that phase. 

<li><b>pz2</b> : Number of pecks to stimulus zone 2 (left) during the
observing response. Meaningless for single-element stimuli of phase 1,
and hence recorded as -1 for that phase. 

<li><b>pz3</b> : Number of pecks to stimulus zone 3 (right) during the
observing response. Meaningless for single-element stimuli of phase 1,
and hence recorded as -1 for that phase. 

<li><b>lsess</b> : <i>Do not use this column</i>. It contains errors - 
see exe13clar.txt
