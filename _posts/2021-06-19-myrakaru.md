Today, I'm listening to Myrakaru's excellent [Tammetoru](http://www.expandingrecords.com/releases.html#myrakaru) - again. From 2004, it's an ambient, downtempo, somewhat glitch-based electronic instrumental album. Beautiful and relaxing, I think I must have listened to this while working more than 100 times over the years. I've always assumed, on no particular basis, that Myrakaru was a Japanese artist, but it turns out they were an [Estonian duo](http://www.expandingrecords.com/artists.html). 

The subtitle of this post comes from the [Igloo](https://igloomag.com/reviews/myrakaru-tammetoru-expanding) magazine review of the album.
