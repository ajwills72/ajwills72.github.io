Ben is a decision-making researcher at the School of Psychology, University of New South Wales, Australia, where he is also the Deputy Head. I hosted Ben during a sabbatical at Exeter, during which time we (and Fraser Milton) decided to investigate a striking, COVIS-inspired, claim by Filoteo et al. (2010). This resulted not only in the three of us publishing together, but also indirectly inspired much of the work pursused by C. Edmunds and Kathryn Carpenter, supervised by myself and Fraser Milton.
