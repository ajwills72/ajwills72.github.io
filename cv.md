- **External examining** (UG, Psychology): Kingston University (2012-2015), Lincoln University (2017 – 2020).

## Research interests

I work on the _psychology and neuroscience of learning_. More specifically: 

- **Attention and learning**. The re-allocation of visual attention in response to errors usually supports fast, efficient learning, but can also lead to systemtically irrational behaviour under certain conditions. 
*Recent review*: Le Pelley,  Mitchell, Beesley, George & Wills (2016). Attention and associative learning in humans. _Psychological Bulletin, 142_, 1111-1140.

- **Computational modelling of categorization**. Improving the quality and impact of computational modelling in psychology. *Key paper*: Wills  & Pothos (2012). On the adequacy of current empirical evaluations of formal models of categorization. _Psychological Bulletin, 138_, 102-125. *Key resource*: catlearn - An R package for computational modelling, downloaded 26,000 times.

- **Object classification**. Object classification involves synthesis of object representations over time, not analysis of initially holistic forms. *Key paper*: Wills, Inkster & Milton (2015). Combination or Differentiation? _Cognitive Psychology, 80_, 1-33.

- **Dual-process theory**. Existing evidence for dual-process theories of learning and categorization is flawed, I aim to develop more adequate procedures. *Recent commentary*: Wills, Edmunds, Le Pelley, Milton, Newell, Dwyer & Shanks (2019). Dissociable learning processes, associative theory, and testimonial reviews _Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 26_, 1988-1993.
